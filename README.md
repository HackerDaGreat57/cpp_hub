# C++ Hub
C++ Hub is a place where any Windows user can learn C++, and many C++ APIs.

The code is compressed into 50MB 7-Zip chunks, because of Git's file size limits and Visual Studio's true love of ginormous binary files. To extract the code, select all numbered archives (.001, .002, .003, etc) and right click, go to 7-Zip menu, then click "Extract to *\". Done! Now place the folder at the root of C:\. So now the solution file should be located at C:\cpp_hub\cpp_hub.sln, and then you're good to go for tinkering. Otherwise, consider this repository as a regular one (Feel free to create issues, pull requests, etc. But there is a special requirement for pull requests and committing to the code. Read more about this below the To-Do List.)
