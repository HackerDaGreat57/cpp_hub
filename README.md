# C++ Hub
C++ Hub is a place where any Windows user can learn C++, and many C++ APIs.

The code is compressed into 50MB 7-Zip chunks, because of Git's file size limits. To extract the code, select all numbered archives (.001, .002, .003, etc) and right click, go to 7-Zip menu, then click "Extract to *\". Done! Now place the folder at the root of C:\. So now the solution file should be located at C:\cpp_hub\cpp_hub.sln, and then you're good to go!
